        <h1>Chicago&rsquo;s very first architectural river cruise:</h1>

        <p>In 1981, two lawyers – Terry Johnson and Paul McCarthy –<br>
        purchased the <em>Betty Jean</em> and began a private charter business<br>
        called &ldquo;Chicago From the Lake.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>At a time when &ldquo;boat rides&rdquo; and charters loaded their<br>
        passengers and beelined for the Lake to view Chicago&rsquo;s magnificent<br> 
        skyline, a friend and client, the late James Bidwill (of the<br>
        Merchandise Mart and later Chairman of the Chicago Convention<br>
        and Tourism Bureau) suggested a river cruise complete with<br>
        a docent — and thus a new industry was born.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;CFL&rdquo; moved to North Pier on the &ldquo;Ogden Slip&rdquo;, added<br>
        the <em>Ft. Dearborn, Marquette,</em> and <em>Innisfree</em> to its fleet and became<br>
        Chicago Line Cruises.  More than 3 million visitors have since<br>
        enjoyed our narrated tour through the city of broad shoulders<br>
        and vertical dreams, and we hope you will too.</p>
