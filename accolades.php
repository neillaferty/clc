        <p>&ldquo;Funny, engaging and incredibly well informed tour guide. Good size<br>
        boat (not too big or small) and complimentary Starbucks Coffee, tea, soft <br>
        drinks and cookies! What&rsquo;s not to love about this boat tour?!&rdquo;<br>

        <p>&ldquo;Their architectural tour is hands down the best in the city! <br>
        Their staff is really professional, fun and knowledgeable. <br>
        The boat and seats are very comfortable. I've had the pleasure of being <br>
        on their smaller, more intimate boat, and the larger <br>
        one -- both are great and provide superb, nearly unobstructed <br>
        views of the beautiful city. I got TONS of great photos!&rdquo;<br>

        <p>&ldquo;This was absolutely excellent, I would recommend it to anyone, <br>
        Chicagoan and visitor alike. There are plenty of different architecture tours <br>
        along the Chicago River but Chicago Line Cruises really caters to their <br>
        passengers with coffee, tea, lemonade, and cookies. Our tour guide was <br>
        so knowledgeable, drawing on her decades of living in the city for <br>
        stories, history, and gossip behind the city's best architectural landmarks. <br>
        There are some great photo opportunities and passing right below <br>
        the Willis Tower is thrilling. I would do it again.&rdquo;<br>

        <p>&ldquo;Whether you&rsquo;re a native Chicagoan, a newcomer, or a tourist, <br>
        I can't recommend Chicago Line Cruises highly enough to you. <br>
        The views of the City are spectacular! Perhaps the most <br>
        beautiful views of our City to be found. Bring your camera! (Your real <br>
        camera with a zoom, not just your phone.) There are no bad seats <br>
        on the cruise. Every passenger gets a great view.&rdquo;<br>
